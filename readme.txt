To compile this program, run: javac Prog4.java
The current directory will require dbConnection.java, EmployeeTuple.java, CustomerManipulation.java, ApptManipulation.java, DeptManipulation.java, and Queries.java in order to compile.
You must also add the Oracle JDBC Driver to your classpath environment variable: export CLASSPATH=/usr/lib/oracle/19.8/client64/lib/ojdbc8.jar:${CLASSPATH}

When running Prog4, the user will need to provide their Oracle Username as the first argument, and their Oracle Password as the second argument.
The user will then be presented with a text-based UI that allows them to execute queries and manipulate tables in the Database.

For this project the team utilized the agile workflow process, using GitHub project, each team member selected 
the tasks/feature they wanted to work on. More specifically Raymond primarily worked on the UI. Logan worked on 
creating the functionality that allowed for database manipulation. Carter worked on creating the database/database 
managment. Anthony created the queries. However, no teammate worked on any aspect of the project on their own, and 
each team member collaborated heavily on the planning for the database schema. 
We had multiple Discord sessions where we would work in teams to complete the assignment.
