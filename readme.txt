To run this program the TA will need to compile Prog4.java. When Prog4 is ran the user will need to provide their Oracle username and password, the user will then be presented with a text-base UI with multiple options. 

For this project the team utilized the agile workflow process, using GitHub project, each team member selected the tasks/feature they wanted to work on. More specifically Raymond primarily worked on the UI. Logan worked on creating the functionality that allowed for database manipulation. Carter worked on creating the database/database managment. Anthony created the queries. However, no teammate worked on any aspect of the project on their own. We had multiple Discord sessions where we would work in team to complete the assignment.
